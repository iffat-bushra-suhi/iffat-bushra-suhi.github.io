      <p class="lead">Hello! Welcome to AniArt Today’s Terms of Service. 
	  Please read this carefully before using our site, services, or products. This is a contract between you and AniArt Today. 
	  We've also included several annotations that aren't a part of the contract itself, but are intended to emphasize key sections and help you follow the text. 
	  We've tried to be fair and straightforward. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or suggestions!</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p><h3>1. Accepting the Terms of Service:</h3>

Please read these Terms of Service and our Community Guidelines (collectively, the "Agreement") carefully before using aniarttoday.com (the "Site") and/or the other domains, websites, products, applications, mobile applications, services, and/or Content provided by AniArt Today, Inc. (all of those collectively with the Site, the "Services") (AniArt Today, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Automattic Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Automattic"), collectively with its agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors, "AniArt Today," "we," or "us"). 
By using or accessing the Services, you ("Subscriber" or "you") agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>If you don't agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you shouldn't, and aren't permitted to, use the Services. 
AniArt Today’s personalized Services cannot be provided and the terms of this Agreement cannot be performed without AniArt Today processing information about you and other users. 
Processing of the information you share with AniArt Today is essential to the personalized Services which we provide and which you expect, including personalized Content (as described below) and ads, and is a necessary part of our performance of the agreement we have with you.</p>
      <p></p>

      <p><h3>2. Modifications to this Agreement:</h3>

AniArt Today reserves the right to modify this Agreement by (1) posting a revised Agreement on and/or through the Services and (2) providing notice to you that this Agreement has changed, generally via email where practicable, and otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification on your AniArt Today Dashboard or in our mobile applications). 
Modifications will not apply retroactively. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Agreement.

We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to (or reject) a revised version of this Agreement. 
In such cases, modifications will be effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of this Agreement. 
If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use the Services.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><h3>3. Use of the Services:</h3>
	  
	  You may not use the Services, provide any personal information to AniArt Today, or otherwise submit personal information through the Services (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number, or email address) if you are under the Minimum Age. 
	  The Minimum Age is (i) thirteen (13), or (ii) for users in the European Union, sixteen (16) (or the lower age that your country has provided for you to consent to the processing of your personal data) .</p>
	  
	  <p>You may only use the Services if you can form a binding contract with AniArt Today and are not legally prohibited from using the Services.
	  The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change without prior notice to you. 
	  AniArt Today retains the right to create limits on and related to use of the Services in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice.
	  AniArt Today may also impose limits on certain Services or aspects of those Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.
	  AniArt Today may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Content (as defined below). 
	  AniArt Today may also terminate or suspend Accounts (as defined below) at any time, in its sole discretion.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p><h3>4. Registration, AniArt Today URLs, and Security:</h3>

As a condition to using certain of the Services and in order for us to provide them to you, you may be required to create an account (an "Account"), provide your age and an email address and select a password and AniArt Today username, which will serve as a default link to your default AniArt Today blog of the form [username].aniarttoday.com (a "AniArt Today URL").</p>

<p>You must select a different AniArt Today URL for each new blog you create.
You agree to provide AniArt Today with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, particularly your email address.
You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account password and for the security of your Account, and you will notify AniArt Today immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Account or Account password.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><h3>5. Privacy:</h3>

For information about how AniArt Today collects, uses, and shares your information, please review our Privacy Policy.
By using the Services you agree you have read the Privacy Policy, which describes our collection, use, and sharing (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of such information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing, and use by AniArt Today and the AniArt Today Affiliates.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <p><h3>6. Subscriber Content:</h3>
	  When you provide Subscriber Content to AniArt Today through the Services, you grant AniArt Today a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), and create derivative works of, such Subscriber Content.</p> 
	  
	  <p>The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purposes of allowing AniArt Today to operate the Services in accordance with their functionality, improve and promote the Services, and develop new Services.
	  The reference in this license to "creat[ing] derivative works" is not intended to give AniArt Today a right to make substantive editorial changes or derivations, but does, for example, enable reblogging, which allows AniArt Today Subscribers to redistribute Subscriber Content from one AniArt Today blog to another in a manner that allows them to add their own text or other Content before or after your Subscriber Content.
	  When you upload your creations to AniArt Today, you’re giving us permission to make them available in all the ways you would expect us to (for example, via your blog, RSS, the AniArt Today. Dashboard, etc.). We never want to do anything with your work that surprises you.</p>
	  
	  <p>Note also that this license to your Subscriber Content continues even if you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of Content shared through AniArt Today’s Services - when you post something publicly, others may choose to comment on it, making your Content part of a social conversation that can’t later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others.</p>
